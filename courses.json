Since stress physiology can be expanded into many far-reaching and different areas, we will focus on specific topics that have a historical background and, at the same time, are pertinent in today's world.  We will examine basic concepts of how stressors are received by the body and how it responds in both healthy and pathological situations.  You will be able to relate many of the situations discussed in class to life events.  In the end, you will acquire a better understanding of external, environmental and internal stressors and why we need some of them for normal growth and development.  Finally, you will learn to apply concepts gained in this class to actual research presented in the scientific literature, and apply this ability to real-world scenarios in the future."

The goal of cultural anthropology is to make the strange familiar and the familiar strange. In learning about the lives of others, the student of anthropology gains a deeper insight into their own culture. Students will first learn about the basics of cultural anthropology, including diversity and relativism, language and culture, and the history and variation of the human species. Students will then apply this knowledge to the study of individual societies with an emphasis on small-scale, traditional groups, focusing on various aspects of culture including marriage and kinship, sex and gender, economics, politics, and religion. The course concludes with a section on the rise of colonialism and its lingering consequences, covering topics such caste and class, race and ethnicity, inequality, and globalization. At the end of the semester, students will (1) learn the basic concepts, methods, and theories of cultural anthropology; (2) develop a deeper cultural literacy, becoming more aware and respectful of diversity; and, (3) have a better sense of our interconnected world and their particular place in it."

Every one of us makes sense of the people we interact with by assigning them to meaning-laden categories that are specific to where and when we live. Scientists and their authoritative statements on human biology have played an influential role in reinforcing or re-imagining these categories and meanings. Whether deliberate or not, describing and interpreting human biology has been a powerful \"social weapon\" and often contributed to entrenched discrimination through a deterministic view of poverty, crime, gender roles or sexuality, and racial or ethnic difference. The initial readings, class discussion, and assignments in this course will require you to consider cross-cultural diversity in racial categories and more universal cognitive structures for category making. Later units explore the history of what scientists think they know about human variation and its repercussions that are most obvious in medicine and law. The following units provide a state of the art view of human global genetic diversity and a series of case studies on adaptation to various environmental conditions such as infectious disease, climate, and diet. Both emphasize how human biodiversity emerged through biological and cultural mechanisms. The final weeks of the course focus on understanding human behaviors including intelligence, athleticism, aggression, and sexuality."

Human genomes contain a wealth of information such that anthropologists and geneticists have mined global genetic diversity to describe the ancestry of the people all over the world. In doing so, they have described ancient and recent population movements and mixtures, identified genetic signatures of adaptation to local environmental pressures, highlighted the pervasive influence of culture on human biodiversity, and helped wipe away any genetic basis for racial categories in humans. Students in the course apply population genetic methods to public databases using current software to understand how we know what we think we know about human genetic diversity."

Weaving as a process is ancient, but also has a strong representation and role in contemporary art and technology. Woven structure is formed from a warp, vertical threads stretched taut through a loom, and weft, the horizontal threads passed back and forth through the warp by the weaver, to create the grid of fabric. The process of weaving is binary, the structure is determined by lifting and lowering the threads of the warp. The more complex the lift pattern, the more complex the weave of the fabric.

Our inquiry begins with an exploration of the rococo as an ornamental style; we examine its origins in Italian garden architecture and subsequent transformation into a decoration for both French palatial interiors and German Churches.  We then launch a succession of case studies of important artists, media, and objects in order to assess the varied ways that diverse social identities were deflected through the periods' art an architecture.  Students will pursue a research topic on rococo art for their semester project."

Teaching of science rarely discusses the contributions or marginalizations of under-represented groups. Meanwhile, many women and indigenous cultures have contributed to progress in STEM but are often not recognized. In this course we will investigate these contributions, and the lack of recognition both historically and in the present day. The aim is to provide students with a better understanding of the advantages of and challenges in inclusive, diverse science. Initially the course will use astronomy as its frame of reference because the sky was one of the earliest laboratories and consequently it has a long history with many indigenous cultures developing their own cosmologies and ways of studying the sky. As we discuss the role of Indigenous peoples, people of color, and women, we will investigate the role of power structures as well as systemic biases in the marginalization of these groups. This class will be strongly discussion oriented, with assessment based on the development throughout the semester, of a final project. As many students will be pursuing graduate school in STEM fields, the final project will be to develop a Broader Impact statement. Many federal funding agencies request or even require that research grants include a component aimed at \"broadening participation\", i.e. making STEM more inclusive and diverse. Student will work on a multipart assignment that will culminate in a Broader Impact statement - that may well be directly applicable to an NSF GRFP (Graduate Research Fellowship Program) or NSF Post-Doctoral Fellowship. In addition to the Broader Impact statement - students will give presentations and learn how to be more inclusive in their presentation design, following the principles of Inclusive Design for Learning.

Between 1948 and 1994, race was the formal organizing principle of the South African state. However, way before the institutionalization of the policy of Apartheid in 1948, race had underlined social, economic and political relations in what is now South Africa. Significantly, democratic South Africa is still grappling with the legacies of racialized rule. This course is about this nexus between race and politics in the history of South Africa. Organized around seminars, guest lectures and tours, the course introduces students to how scholars have understood race and politics in this Southern African nation. It further examines the social and economic context in which race was deployed as an instrument of making difference and exercising power and how this is contested. Finally, the course examines the legacies of racialized rule in democratic South Africa. Graded on A-F basis only."

It provides useful tools to learn about participants' understandings and experiences of a social issue, process, or phenomena and to discover and construct theory to account for the social processes being studied.

      "description": "(same as JOURN 7370; cross-leveled with JOURN 4370 and FILMS_VS 4370). The popularity of documentary film in the past ten years has skyrocketed, and recent award-winning documentaries such as Inside Job (2010), Blackfish (2013), and The Invisible War (2012) are simultaneously entertaining audiences and investigating serious issues like the financial collapse, killer whale captivity, and sex crimes in the military--issues that in the past might have been covered exclusively by investigative journalism. What explains the public's growing fascination with documentary? How is documentary film reacting to recent transformations in the media landscape? Is it filling a critical need that journalism is no longer willing or able to meet? This course will explore the intersection of these two nonfiction storytelling forms--documentary film and journalism--and examine the role played by advocacy in both modes, as well as the cultural and ethical implications of the convergence between journalism and documentary film. In that it is centered on contemporary documentary film culture, the course also takes advantage of the True/ False Film Festival, and will be host to a conference during Week 6, featuring a number of major visiting filmmakers and film critics. Attendance at some sessions is required. Graded on A-F basis only."

The purposes of this course are to 1) analyze patterns in the history of life and 2) to recognize the biased processes that led to its preservation.

Through careful examination of both the rare and the hyper-abundant, we can address the fundamental question of paleobiology: how literally can the fossil record be read as the history of life?

In this course we will seek to answer these and many more questions by delving into the cultural history of Germans and German immigration to the state from the nineteenth century to the present. The purpose of this course is to learn about the cultural history of the state and region and its connections to global histories. This course will speak to students interested in regional tourism and commerce; state and US history; German studies; international studies; refugee and migration studies; and more. We will explore the forces that shaped the lives of German immigrants and their descendants in Missouri: large numbers of German immigrants play formative roles in local and state governments; they are involved in transforming much of the landscape into farmland; they create a wide range of businesses, most notably the many breweries that blanketed the state; they found a variety of churches, settle in religious communities, and establish most of the early synagogues. They are involved in debates about the Civil War and in the build up to the World Wars of the twentieth century. The history of Missouri, in this sense, is part and parcel of both German and American history, and the goal of this class is to allow students to participate in writing it. This is not a typical course based on lectures and discussions. It is based on a joint effort to learn more about German Missouri with a strong component of project-based learning. Students will be encouraged to explore parts of the state and its history, and when applicable, to explore their own family backgrounds as immigrants. As a final project, students will do a history of a specific cultural object, working in tandem with Missouri Humanities and the German Heritage project. Anything used will be credited to students in the displays. This course is conducted in English."

We will examine this on both a practical and a more abstract level, focusing first on writings that delineate why colonists grew to perceive the economic, social, and political conditions of British rule as insufferable, and then on how they translated these practical concerns into a more ideological justification of violent revolution."

The course will introduce important concepts of editing, the work of significant editors in both documentary and narrative fiction films, and seek to apply those techniques to the conceptualization of documentary work students will do as part of their degree. Students will understand the history of documentary editing as it evolved on its own and as influenced by narrative fiction films, the language of editing, the work of important editors and directors and how it influences today's aesthetic and how to apply what they have learned to their own documentary projects at an advanced level.

The popularity of documentary film in the past ten years has skyrocketed, and recent award-winning documentaries such as Inside Job (2010), Blackfish (2013), and The Invisible War (2012) are simultaneously entertaining audiences and investigating serious issues like the financial collapse, killer whale captivity, and sex crimes in the military-issues that in the past might have been covered exclusively by investigative journalism. What explains the public's growing fascination with documentary? How is documentary film reacting to recent transformations in the media landscape? Is it filling a critical need that journalism is no longer willing or able to meet?  This course will explore the intersection of these two nonfiction storytelling forms--documentary film and journalism--and examine the role played by advocacy in both modes, as well as the cultural and ethical implications of the convergence between journalism and documentary film.  In that it is centered on contemporary documentary film culture, the course also takes advantage of the True/ False Film Festival, and will be host to a conference during Week 6, featuring a number of major visiting filmmakers and film critics.

The course will introduce important concepts of editing, the work of significant editors in both documentary and narrative fiction films, and seek to apply those techniques to the conceptualization of documentary work students will do as part of their degree. Students will understand the history of documentary editing as it evolved on its own and as influenced by narrative fiction films, the language of editing, the work of important editors and directors and how it influences today's aesthetic and how to apply what they have learned to their own documentary projects at an advanced level.

First, the transition of power in the North Korea was made through the hereditary succession like a monarchy even though it claimed to be a socialist country.  Second, North Korea has survived as a socialist country, while most of the communist countries including the Soviet Union and East European countries collapsed in the late 1980s and the early 1990s.  Third, the North Korea, one of the poorest countries, has developed the nuclear weapons as well as other weapons of mass destruction, threatening the international security. For critical understanding of the North Korean politics I will trace the Korean communist movement, and deal with the North Korean political history since 1945.  I am also planning to deal with the ideology and important governmental structure including the Korean Workers' party, the Military Commission and the social control structures.  Then I will examine the current issues including economic reforms, the nuclear challenge, and the several issues with the South Korea like unification questions and the conclusion of the peace treaty to end the Korean War."

It provides useful tools to learn about participants' understandings and experiences of a social issue, process, or phenomena and to discover and construct theory to account for the social processes being studied.

Next, students learn how to identify meaningful issues for customers in a more focused context, how to generate multiple solutions and form these into cohesive business concepts, and how to carefully test for feasible value with potential customers using rough prototypes (this course). Finally, students learn how to develop a comprehensive business plan in areas like operations, marketing, finance, and human resources based on a business model concept for a given industry (MANGMT 4730). Such a detailed plan can used to appeal to potential funding sources and serves as a guide for strategic action by a new venture.

Assisting others in creating new ventures is very different from creating your own business or consulting to established companies and facilitators are required to take different actions depending on the situation. In this course students will work directly with aspiring entrepreneurs and/or investors and be guided through the process of conducting an entrepreneurial human and social capital analysis, before conducting an in-depth audit of resources available to the entrepreneur that will fill identified gaps. In the second half of the course, students work with the entrepreneur/inventor and other relevant resource providers in a structured and disciplined manner using a design-innovation process that has been shown to dramatically increasing the probability of creating a successful innovation. Graded on A-F basis only."

The course will cover most topics broadly and occasionally in great depth, highlighting the perils and pitfalls of different methods, while providing guidelines for a wide array of statistical approaches to data analysis. The course seeks to find the balance between really understanding all the math involved and learning to be a competent practitioner and consumer of analysis, emphasizing the practical over the theoretical, with additional focus on the communication of data (plotting, graphs, figures) and of results.

Meanwhile, many women and indigenous cultures have contributed to progress in STEM but are often not recognized. In this course we will investigate these contributions, and the lack of recognition both historically and in the present day. The aim is to provide students with a better understanding of the advantages of and challenges in inclusive, diverse science. Initially the course will use astronomy as its frame of reference because the sky was one of the earliest laboratories and consequently it has a long history with many indigenous cultures developing their own cosmologies and ways of studying the sky. As we discuss the role of Indigenous peoples, people of color, and women, we will investigate the role of power structures as well as systemic biases in the marginalization of these groups. This class will be strongly discussion oriented, with assessment based on the development throughout the semester, of a final project. As many students will be pursuing graduate school in STEM fields, the final project will be to develop a Broader Impact statement. Many federal funding agencies request or even require that research grants include a component aimed at 'broadening participation', i.e. making STEM more inclusive and diverse. Student will work on a multipart assignment that will culminate in a Broader Impact statement that may well be directly applicable to an NSF GRFP (Graduate Research Fellowship Program) or NSF Post-Doctoral Fellowship.

These events and developments will be examined in light of major theories in and methodological approaches adopted by the subfields of comparative politics and international relations, with the goal of exploring the strengths and weaknesses of alternative perspectives. At the end of the course, students should be familiar with the key debates and questions in the study of Chinese politics and foreign policy, and have a better sense of how to research questions on these topics. The course is also intended to encourage a dialogue between the study of China and the broader fields of comparative politics and international relations. Thus by the end of the course, students should have a sense not only for how the study of Chinese politics and foreign policy applies broader CP/IR theories to explain key patterns and events in China, but also gain insight into the question of what China as a case (or cases) can contribute back to major theories and debates in these fields."
